# University-Campus-model-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

## Overview
This project simulates a wireless network for a university campus, encompassing both the campus area and the hostel area. The primary goal is to demonstrate the wireless connectivity used in universities to ensure efficient and mobile networking. The focus on mobility is crucial, providing equal functionality to all users, including college staff and students.

To achieve this, the simulation includes essential services such as DNS, Email, and HTTP servers, maximizing resource utilization. The campus network facilitates various services such as internet access, data sharing among users, and access to web services, ensuring smooth processing through wireless networking.
